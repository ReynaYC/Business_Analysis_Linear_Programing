    "Mercotic is a leader in slip-ring industry. A $750,000 order has just been received. Unfortunately, Mercotic does not have enough wiring and harnessing capacity to fill the order by its due date. However, the company can subcontract any portion of this order to one of its competitors. Mercotic wants to determine the number of slip rings to make and number to buy to fill the customer order at the least possible cost. All the necessary information is given in the table below. The wiring and harnessing capacities are 11,000 and 4,500 hours, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) How much of each model should Mercotic buy and make to minimize costs?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)\tSuppose now that Mary, Mercotic’s CEO would like to make sure that the firm produces at least as many Model 2s as Model 3s. She believes that this will decrease costs. Do you agree with this claim?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c)\tMary consults industrial and manufacturing engineers, and they suggest that with a new process, each model can be produced using half of their current harnessing requirements. If this new process costs $10,000, should Mercotic use it?   (Assume that Marc doesn’t require at least as many Model 2s and Model 3s.)\n",
    "\n",
    "(d)\tMary suspects that only the relative costs of making and buying rather than the exact costs matter in the optimal solution. Specifically, she thinks that if the costs of making and buying increases by the same percentage, the optimal plan stays the same. Is she correct?\n"
