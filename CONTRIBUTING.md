# Contributing to Business_Analysis
ðŸŽ‰ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to this repo. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs/Issues 
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce (Be specific!)
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Making Changes 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). Before making a pull request: 

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Make changes to the code. 
3. Ensure your changes are not breaking anything. 
4. Write documentation about your changes. 
5. Issue that pull request!

## MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
